# U.S-Married-Couples-Work-or-Household-Data
The goal of this project is to analyze a dataset of 753 U.S. married individuals, focusing on how being a housewife affects household income. We aim to identify key factors influencing work patterns and family dynamics, providing insights into economic impacts. To analyze how being a housewife affects household income, we used empirical econometric methodolgies such as Exact and Nearest Neighbor Matching, OLS Regression, Regression Adjustment, and Instrumental Variables to address omitted-variable bias and simultaneous equations.
